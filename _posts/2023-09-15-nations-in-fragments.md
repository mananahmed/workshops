## About

Partha Chatterjee is one of the most original and critical thinkers of nationalism, populism, and postcolonial democracy. A leading historian, anthropologist, political theorist, and public intellectual, Chatterjee's path-breaking work has shaped a generation of scholarship on the politics and history of the nation-state in postcolonial times. A founding member of the “Subaltern Studies” collective, his scholarship critiqued much of the conventional wisdom about nationalism in the 1980s and 1990s. _Nationalist Thought and the Colonial World_ (1986) was a landmark statement on the discursive contradictions and limits of anti-colonial nationalism. In the acclaimed intervention _The Nation and its Fragments: Colonial and Postcolonial Histories_, Chatterjee deftly pivoted away from state-centered ideas of nationhood to chart and conceptualize the heterogeneity internal to nationalism, from historical constructions of difference to the identities and experiences that nationalism reconfigures.

With _The Politics of the Governed: Reflections on Popular Politics in Most of the World_ (2004) and _Lineages of Political Society: Studies in Postcolonial Democracy_ (2011), Chatterjee honed in on practices of popular politics that were invisible to traditional lenses of political theory. He proposed a wholly novel viewpoint and conceptual vocabulary to understand new forms of popular mobilization which themselves were intimately bound with the arrival of postcolonial democracy. Over the past four decades, from _The Nation and Its Fragments_, _The Politics of the Governed_, to _I am the People_, Chatterjee has provided some of the most original and influential theoretical frameworks for the study of the postcolony in Africa, Asia, Latin America and in a fruitful comparative frame with Europe and North America.

“Nations in Fragments” draws together key interlocutors from across the disciplines to engage Professor Chatterjee’s decisive scholarly interventions on nationalism and democracy and build new conceptual vocabularies to meet the challenges of democratic decline, nationalist resurgence, capitalist crises, and climate catastrophe.
